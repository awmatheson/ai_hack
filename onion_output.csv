"NEW YORK—Though today he holds a powerful position as head of a leading information technology firm, MergeMedia CEO Gary Lightman told reporters Thursday he, amazingly, worked his way to the very top of the company from humble beginnings as the son of the previous CEO. “A lot of people are surprised when I tell them I started out as a lowly senior vice president right out of college, but it’s true,” said Lightman, 37, who stressed that he had to work every angle to get to where he is today, including being born to the head of the company, being raised by the head of the company, going to the same prestigious business school as the head of company on a legacy scholarship, and being hired at age 22 for a management-level position by the head of the company. “Believe me, I had to sit through a lot of board meetings to get where I am today. If you’d asked me a few years ago if I’d one day be CEO of my dad’s company, I would have said, absolutely not this soon. I thought for sure I’d have to spend a year or two as COO before I made it to the top.” Lightman added that he plans to hold on to his current job until MergeMedia can no longer afford to pay his seven-figure salary, at which point he looks forward to transitioning into retirement.

"WILLOUGHBY, OH—Allowing no window whatsoever for additional conversation to take place, the father of local man Luke Asbury reportedly handed off the phone to Luke’s mother on Sunday immediately after his son wished him a happy Father’s Day. “Wow, he didn’t waste any time—he just said thanks, told me Mom was there if I wanted to speak to her, and then got off the line before I could really answer,” said Asbury, 32, who told reporters that while he in no way expected to chat at length, he did anticipate at least having one or two minutes of small talk about whether his father planned to watch any golf that afternoon. “I don’t think we were even on the line together for 30 seconds before he started wrapping things up. In fact, this might’ve been the earliest he’s ever told me he had to get going. I can’t imagine he’ll be able to top that next year.” At press time, Asbury’s mother put the call on speaker so they could all talk, though his father reportedly remained silent except for what sounded like shuffling out of the room with the newspaper.

"INDIANAPOLIS—Saying they were left with no other choice given the imminent peril of the situation, World Wrestling Entertainment officials confirmed they were forced to kill one of their own stars Friday when a 7-year-old boy wandered into the steel cage enclosure of an aggressive wrestler.  Beloved two-time WWE champion Big Show was reportedly shot dead after the emergency response team at the Indiana Farmers Coliseum made a split-second decision to take out the nearly 400-pound dominant male wrestler, who is said to have appeared aggravated and hostile, causing those present to fear for the small child’s safety.  “Last night, after determining he posed a clear threat to a young boy who had entered the steel cage, we chose to end the life of one of our wrestlers,” said WWE spokesperson Chris Bellitti, who added that the security guards who opened fire had followed protocol, assessing the body language and vocalizations of the 45-year-old wrestler to evaluate the danger he presented. “It is a tragedy anytime something like this happens, but luckily we can say a child is alive today thanks to the swift and appropriate measures taken by our WWE staff.”  “While lethal force is always a last resort, the reality is that we were dealing with a very large adult—one of our strongest males,” Bellitti continued. “A tranquilizer could have taken five, even 10, minutes to bring down a wrestler that size, and it likely would have made him even angrier in the meantime. We simply couldn’t risk waiting any longer to act.”  Though a popular attraction for WWE since his arrival in 1999, the 7-foot, 383-pound Big Show reportedly angered easily and had a history of violent outbursts, often acting belligerently toward other wrestlers to intimidate them and, at times, even confronting officials who entered the ring with him. The wrestler is known to have exhibited erratic behavior on numerous occasions, including several altercations in which individuals required medical attention.  Despite his reputation, WWE representatives insisted the wrestler would never intentionally hurt a child, though they acknowledged he likely interpreted the shouts and flashing cameras of onlookers as a threat, which would have increased the likelihood of a deadly tantrum.  The boy’s mother, Lynn Marshall, who said she and her family had enjoyed going to see the WWE’s wrestlers for years, held back tears as she recalled seeing her defenseless son face-to-face in the steel cage with a hulking behemoth ten times his size.  “I turned my back for a second, and the next thing I knew my son was down there with that huge wrestler,” she said. “I screamed and ran toward the ring as fast as I could, just shouting and shouting for help. The wrestler was stomping around and pumping his fists, and I was completely terrified of what he might do next.”  “When it looked like he was getting ready to pick up my boy and slam him on the canvas, I completely lost it,” she added.  It was at that moment, sources said, that the wrestler was brought down with multiple rifle shots to the head and heart.  Some witnesses blamed Big Show’s death on the boy’s mother, calling her negligent for not keeping a better eye on her child while in such close proximity to dangerous wrestlers. Others reportedly criticized the facility for not having more physical barriers and stronger safety measures to prevent children from coming into contact with a wrestler as powerful and unpredictable as Big Show in the first place.  According to reports, protests soon began outside the arena where the wrestler was fatally shot. Many argued that WWE was at fault, having fostered violent behavior in Big Show and countless other wrestlers by confining them to cramped steel cages—which rarely exceed an area of 20 square feet—and allowing crowds to gawk at them for hours on end.  “An innocent wrestler has paid the ultimate price for a mistake made by someone else,” said Sam Carter, a 25-year-old protester who objected to what he called WWE’s inhumane activities. “When you look at everything these wrestlers are subjected to, it clearly amounts to cruelty. We must put an end to this immoral practice before another Big Show dies.”  Added Carter, “It’s pretty sickening when you consider the fact that they have such short lifespans as it is.”",WWE Staff Forced To Shoot Aggressive Wrestler After Child Climbs Into Steel Cage,,

"Popsugar touts itself as the number one digital lifestyle brand for young women, and in its latest NewFronts delivery, it shared more upcoming programs that will continue to corral its target audience. To power that slate, it has partnered with several other established content producers, including Onion Studios, SoulPancake, and Broadway Video’s Mas Mejor.  Those three companies will each launch their own comedy series alongside Popsugar. Onion Studios will poke fun at mommy bloggers with EveryMom, SoulPancake will imagine a DIY version of The Bachelorette with The Matchelorette, and Mas Mejor — which Broadway Video launched last year to provide a home for Latino creators — will combine humor and Cuban recipes with Cooking Rodriguez.  Popsugar’s brand includes more than just comedies, and its other NewFronts announcements included a partnership with Lean In, a new analytics suite called Popsugar Motion, and a new vertical called Glow, which seems to be emulating the social-friendly success of BuzzFeed ventures like Tasty. The media company also announced that Class Fitsugar, its popular fitness series, will soon be adapted into a daily TV format.  Here, via a Popsugar press release, are details about all the shows the network discussed during its presentation:  COMEDY:  Cooking Rodriguez  POPSUGAR has expanded its successful relationship with Broadway Video through Más Mejor, Broadway Video’s new premium comedy studio powered by Latino voices, in partnership with POPSUGAR Latina. The first project is a scripted comedy, Cooking Rodriguez, created by Marlena Rodriguez (writer on season 2 of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt). COOKING RODRIGUEZ follows Penelope, an aspiring YouTube host, as she cooks her way through her grandmother’s Cuban recipes and, despite her best efforts, falls victim to kitchen mishaps and her grandmother’s sharp tongue.  EveryMom  EveryMom is POPSUGAR’s first project developed through a new partnership with Onion Studios. The scripted show is from the development arm of The Onion, the nation’s leading comedy and news satire brand. The comedy series is about America’s most popular new mommy influencer, who is secretly a single, childless 27-year–old dude living in Brooklyn, NY. The show both satirizes mommy -influencer culture and millennial entitlement while celebrating motherhood. The series was created by The Onion’s editorial director, Josh Modell, who was inspired to create the series based on the experience of having his first child.  The Matchelorette  The Matchelorette is a real-life romantic comedy that follows two best friends as they right swipe enough matches to stage their own DIY version of a Bachelorette-style competition. That’s right, from their tiny bungalow, the search for love (or at least a viable crush) is on . . . unbeknownst to the suitors. The series is produced in partnership with SoulPancake, Rainn Wilson’s award-winning media brand that has become the most recognized name in meaningful entertainment by creating inspiring, uplifting, shareable, and socially relevant content about the human experience.  PETS:  Finding Fido: The Dog Who…  Finding Fido: The Dog Who… tells the emotional true stories of dogs who’ve changed their owners’ lives forever. At the end of each episode, the hero dog will be photographed by famous dog photographer Seth Casteel, capturing a one-of-a-kind image and presenting it to the owner. The online series is inspired by cable network Z Living’s (which has a TV series partnership with POPSUGAR) upcoming television show Finding Fido, produced by 3 Ball Entertainment (The Biggest Loser). The series will also partner with organizations to promote awareness for dog adoption.  BEAUTY:  A Beautiful World  When it comes to beauty, every culture plays by its own rules — and POPSUGAR’s audience is fascinated with them.

"VATICAN CITY—Praising the district’s vast selection of inexpensive goods and its vendors’ willingness to negotiate prices, Pope Francis reportedly spent Thursday afternoon strolling through Vatican City’s Chinatown before purchasing a knockoff golden chalice.  Holy See officials said that after leading Mass at St. Peter’s Basilica, the Bishop of Rome walked the three blocks to the sprawling ethnic Chinese neighborhood known for selling anything from Pentecost fireworks to bootleg homily DVDs, as well as countless other deeply discounted ecclesiastical items.  “I love coming down here every now and then to explore and maybe pick up a few things if I happen upon a good price,” said the pontiff, pausing briefly beside a booth where colorful plastic rosaries hung from a rack and thuribles stamped with the words “Catholic Church” were piled in a bin. “They don’t always have the highest-quality stuff, but if you hunt around you can get a great deal on something at least halfway decent. If I really dig, I know I can find a chalice that’ll transubstantiate wine into the blood of Christ pretty much as well as the real thing.”  “And even if the stem snaps or the jewels come unglued, I’m only out a few bucks,” he added. “I can just get another.”  “I love coming down here every now and then to explore and maybe pick up a few things if I happen upon a good price.”  In addition to retail, the Vatican Chinatown is reportedly home to dozens of storefronts touting alternative sacramental services such as herbal baptisms or reflexology treatments for the sick and dying, often demonstrated on small televisions playing looped video of priests performing the rites. Behind the shops that line Via Pio X and Via di Porta Angelica, penitents can also descend into one of the area’s basement confessional parlors and be absolved of their sins at a cost of three for $5 or seven for 10.  However, due to the quasi-legal nature of some merchants’ business practices, the area is regularly patrolled by members of the Swiss Guard on the lookout for scams. Pope Francis himself has reportedly witnessed sellers hawking what they claimed were the bones of saints or patches of the Shroud of Turin, but who then quickly rolled up their blankets and scattered as soon as they caught sight of the guards.  “You do have to be careful—one time I bought a Latin Vulgate Bible, but when I got home I realized it just cut off right in the middle of Leviticus,” said the pontiff, glancing at himself in a mirror, wearing the visored miter he was considering purchasing. “When I tried to take it back, the lady screamed at me, ‘All sales final!’ What am I going to do, get into a whole thing with her?”  Added the Vicar of Christ, “Oh well, lesson learned.”  As he walked under an ornate Paifang into another winding alleyway of awnings, Pope Francis reportedly stopped at the open-air shop where he buys whole fish in bulk during Lent. Afterward, witnesses said the pontiff bought a mango bubble tea and partook in some window-shopping at various stores selling Ray-Ban sunglasses, swords supposedly used by Templar Knights during the 12th-century crusades, and unlocked smartphones.  “Cardinal Giuseppe told me about this great karaoke place down on Sant’Anna near the Vatican Library that has a huge selection of all the best hymns,” Pope Francis said as he passed by a dim sum stall posting a small menu in both Chinese and rudimentary liturgical Latin. “I think it’s the perfect spot for our midnight Mass afterparty when all the visiting bishops are in town this December. Boy, I’m really going to have to practice my ‘Ave Maria’ before then.”  “It’s so nice to have some things around here that are open on Christmas,” he added.  At press time, several vendors were aggressively waving the pope into their shops with the promise of name-brand ecclesiastical vestments at 75 percent off retail price.",Pope Francis Buys Knockoff Chalice At Store In Vatican City Chinatown,,

The bread should be pitching in a lot more, but it’s just sitting there like it knows the chipotle mayo is going to bail it out eventually—which it will, of course, just like always.” At press time, realizing that even chipotle mayo couldn’t prop up every sandwich on its own indefinitely, Bentley tried easing its burden by adding some crushed potato chips.",Chipotle Mayo Doing All The Heavy Lifting In Sandwich,,

"EDISON, NJ—Citing creative differences that had been festering for at least a decade, Chuck E. Cheese keyboardist Mr. Munch confirmed Wednesday that he had left the band to form a new prog-rock outfit, The Mr. Munch Experience.  The longtime Chuck E. Cheese performer, whose songwriting credits include such hits as “You’re A Winner” and “The Future Looks Fun To Me,” told reporters that while he was proud of what the band had accomplished musically, he had begun to feel stifled by the group’s “mainstream sound” and “repetitive birthday-themed set list.”  “Sure, part of me still loves jamming about eating pizza and having fun with your friends, but there’s so much more to being an artist than just showing up and singing the same 20 songs over and over,” said Mr. Munch, complaining that the group hadn’t put out any new material since the commercial, radio-friendly “Giant Armadillo Named Phil.” “But anytime I suggested we push ourselves in a more experimental direction, that we not be afraid to challenge kids a little, Chuck just shot me down.”  “I guess you gotta know when to pack it in,” Mr. Munch added. “If nothing else, I’ll never have to sing ‘so let’s have a party’ ever again.”  According to the keyboardist, The Mr. Munch Experience would ideally resemble something of an “aural journey,” taking listeners to far-off soundscapes where strands of mozzarella stretch across infinity and sauce erupts from marinara volcanoes. Without the constraints of an established sound, Mr. Munch reportedly plans to explore ideas like polyrhythms, slide whistles, microtones, and confetti cannons—all of which would have clashed with the Chuck E. Cheese band’s more traditional, pop-oriented format.  The Mr. Munch Experience would ideally resemble something of an “aural journey,” taking listeners to far-off soundscapes where strands of mozzarella stretch across infinity and sauce erupts from marinara volcanoes.  Mr. Munch explained that his new project would have a much more free-form style that wouldn’t be afraid to “get a little cosmic.” He added that he had just finished a rough demo of a 12-part song, an ambient “synth voyage” titled “Gooey Galactic” that culminated with a long fade-out of him whispering the word “toppings” in reverse.  The musician also confirmed he had already begun collaborating with longtime friend and Parliament-Funkadelic bass player Bootsy Collins on an epic 40-minute “rebirthing” of “If You’re Happy And You Know It.”  “One of the things I’m most excited about is this multi-part rock opera called ‘Pepperonium’ that takes place in the year 2790 on a planet made entirely of melted cheese,” said Mr. Munch, describing how the idea came to him during a recent peyote session with his girlfriend, a 19-year-old Chuck E. Cheese’s waitress who chants atonally in the song’s background. “It’s going to be wild. I recorded the sound of a wooden paddle sliding under a pizza in a scorching-hot oven. It’s just three seconds long, but we slowed it down to four minutes.”  “The lead single is about how we’re all living on a single ball in a gigantic ball pit,” Mr. Munch continued. “It’s a total mindfuck.”  Mr. Munch, who reiterated that he still had the utmost respect for his former bandmates’ technical chops, admitted that they had drifted apart due to a toxic mix of personalities—a rift that was compounded by their grueling 365-days-a-year performance schedule.  “Chuck and I have been good buds from back in the day, but I’ve never seen eye to eye with Jasper T. Jowls,” said Mr. Munch, referring to the group’s lead guitarist, whom he claimed was an out-of-control drunk who “always played over everyone.” “I’m here to make music, but Pasqually P. Pieplate and Helen Henny were constantly bringing their personal stuff onstage every damn night, like anyone at a birthday party is supposed to care.”  “Boy, am I glad to be done with that bullshit,” added Mr. Munch.

"DENVER—Noting that some discomfort should be expected while traveling to a faraway place in just a few goddamn hours, officials from ultra-low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines reportedly told customers Thursday to just fucking deal with it. “I get that you’re cramped and miserable, but if you just shut the hell up and sit there for a few goddamn hours, you’ll soon be at your destination,” said CEO Barry L.

"The nation is still in shock about the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, but The Onion kind of called Trump's success back in 2012. After President Obama was reelected, the satirical newspaper made a fake newscast about how  Some experts say a frontrunner has already emerged in the form of this shrieking white-hot sphere of pure rage.  Explains fake news anchor Andrea Bennett:  The sphere, seen here decimating homes in a small Maryland town, is testing through the roof with conservatives who are disappointed with Obama's victory last night.  Not exactly Trump, but there are some clear similarities.  Hear me out. Trump's campaign has centered around anger at the current state of the nation, from the way China's  raping  America on trade to the lack of jobs for American citizens. He's a pretty mad human in general, constantly firing off Twitter rants, attacking journalists who criticize him, and calling his political opponents names. He also relentlessly denounces President Obama's policies and the progress he's tried to enact while in office. Not to mention how his face is a similar shade of orange to that of the orb.   This screaming orb just might be the only one who really taps into the deep-seated seething fury felt by so many Republicans right now,  says phony journalist Jason Copeland.  This thing is young, it's exciting, it feeds off fear and terror — it's no wonder conservatives are raving about it.   A Republican interviewed about why she's so drawn to the orb says:  Mitt Romney just didn't get me fired up enough to vote, but that sphere of anger really speaks to me ... usually through my television or in my nightmares.   When asked if it would run for president, the orb made loud whirring sounds and unintelligible shrieks before saying,  Bow before me,  followed by more piercing violent shrieks and  Guns. Not our America.  Then, it just repeated  fa*****s  at a deafening pitch for hours. In order to get it to run, Copeland said conservatives would have to trap the orb, communicate with it, and steer it in the right direction, but GOP leaders had already begun offering sacrifices of virgins and animals — a vital first step.    No one had to convince Trump to run for president (he was pretty eager to do so), but his slogan is quite similar to the shrieking orb's  Not our America.

"WASHINGTON—Staring in horror at the profane legislative ritual taking place around him, a robed Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) reportedly infiltrated congressional Republicans’ secret, torchlit American Health Care Act ceremony deep in the woods behind the U.S. Capitol late Tuesday night. “I heard this eerie chanting as I left my office, and when I followed the sound I saw a line of GOP senators in long, flowing vestments being led into the forest by Mitch McConnell,” said Warner, explaining that he quickly donned an extra robe he found behind a tree and then quietly fell in formation at the rear of the column of conservative lawmakers in hopes of catching a glimpse of their mysterious health policy deliberations. “Eventually we reached a clearing where the senators started dancing around a bonfire while repeating in unison the list of all preexisting conditions that would no longer be covered under the new law. And all the while, McConnell kept exalting the name of the AHCA, praising it as the ‘great upper-class tax cutter’ and ‘slayer of Medicaid’ while waving the pages of the draft bill overhead. It was terrifying.” Warner added that he had to place his hand over his mouth to keep from screaming during the ceremony’s conclusion when Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) and Sen.

"I’ve witnessed some sorry fucking sights in my life, but the display you just put on in front of that nursing home crowd was the most pathetic excuse for Christian-themed slapstick I’ve ever seen. Dropped lines, missed cues, and I don’t know what you all thought you were doing during the Ten Commandments skit, but it sure as shit wasn’t what we rehearsed.  Come on, are we just a bunch of assholes fucking around here? Or is this a clown ministry?  We’ve got standards to live up to. We’re not just some dipshits in polka-dot overalls and fright wigs playing grab-ass. We’re clown ministers—righteous Christians called to preach the word of the Gospels through costumes, props, and physical comedy.  Maybe you forgot, but when you put on those big floppy shoes and that Jesus-fish necktie, you’re not just some grease-painted jerk-off standing there with your thumb in your ass. You are a messenger of our Lord and Savior. We’re supposed to be saving souls here—using our comic antics to spread hope, faith, and Christian goodwill. Do you think we opened the audience’s hearts one fucking iota to the everlasting love of Jesus with that huge stinking turd of a puppet show you just tried to pass off as the parable of the prodigal son?    Seriously, are you fuckwits here to share the good news of the Kingdom of Heaven through lighthearted hijinks and pantomime or to yank on your goddamn dicks?  Seriously, are you fuckwits here to share the good news of the Kingdom of Heaven through lighthearted hijinks and pantomime or to yank on your goddamn dicks?  Yeah, I’m talking to you, Father Rumplebottom. When you play Judas chasing Saint Glitterbug and Jingles the Penitent around the Last Supper table with a seltzer bottle, you’re supposed to slip and fall on your 30 pieces of silver. That’s the punchline to the whole bit, for crying out loud! Same goes for you, Blowflower T. Hezekiah. A fucking monkey could’ve made a better Immaculate Heart of Mary balloon sculpture than you did this afternoon. Oh, and by the way—just how exactly are we supposed to glorify God with our walls of Jericho tumbling routine when half of you shitheads forgot your trumpets in the van?  Do you think the greats, clown ministers like Faithful Bonko or ChooChoo the Prophet, ever phoned it in like that? No. When they were supposed to teach a Sunday school class the story of Noah’s Ark, they got out there and started pulling stuffed animals out of their sleeves, two of each kind, in an endless chain, until they had the attention of every kid in that audience. You can’t just throw on a red nose and an oversized crucifix necklace and expect a group of recovering alcoholics or terminally ill children to invite the Holy Spirit into their hearts right then and there—especially not when you’re out there pissing around like a gaggle of bumbling dildos like you were today.  Most of the seniors in that rec room had nodded off by the time we got to Humble Doink’s burning bush ventriloquism act, and with the god-awful snoozefest you just put on, I can’t say I blame them.  Look, it’s up to you. If you’d rather sit around and wank each other off than spread the wisdom of the Lord, that’s fine—just go do it somewhere else.

The unspeakable malevolence that befell me will soon descend upon you—a woeful tempest tears through Meadowlark Elementary, leaving nothing but misery and ruination in its path,” said Milfay, a shudder passing through her weary, sallow countenance as she spoke of a classroom disrupted by rampant misbehavior and screeching voices “unconstrained by any empty commandment to raise one’s hand.” “Beware foremost the one who calls himself Trevor, he of the wavy brown hair and shark-tooth necklace. The others follow his lead, and if his mockery is loosed upon you, your doom will be sealed by the multitude.

"FORT WAYNE, IN—According to local computer programmer and Keira Knightley fan Tom Hayes, 38, the internationally known English film actress and model responded  much too fast  to the letter he sent just a few days ago.   All I wrote was, 'I'm a big fan and I would love it if you would autograph this picture,'  Hayes told reporters Thursday, holding Knightley's unusually prompt and thorough response to his original two- sentence-long letter.  But then, just four days later—exactly four days—there's a FedEx guy at my door asking me to sign for an overnight delivery from Keira Knightley. I just figured it was some sort of mistake or joke, but it wasn't.    Now, think about that: I sent my letter by regular mail all the way to London, so in order for me to have received her reply so quickly, she literally must have read my letter the moment it got to her and then responded immediately,  Hayes continued.  That seems a little weird, right?   Assuming that his original letter had simply been returned to sender, Hayes was surprised to find the package contained a 12-page handwritten document, a signed color photograph of Keira Knightley much larger than the black-and-white portrait of the actress he had sent, a variety of English candies, another photograph of a smiling Knightley holding Hayes' letter, and a few small handmade pencil drawings, presumably of the movie star's pets.  Despite the fact that Hayes had actually mailed his letter to the 25-year-old performer's agent in London and not to Knightley herself, the Academy Award–nominated actress's response included her home address, her e-mail, private phone numbers for various residences in the U.K. and U.S., and 20 sheets of artisanal, pearl-foiled paper upon which Hayes was instructed to write his reply.  Hayes also confirmed that a second copy of Knightley's letter arrived a few hours later with a note attached reading,  In case the first one got lost in the mail! Yours, Keira.    And then the actual letter she wrote—man, you should see this thing,  said Hayes, shaking his head as he scanned the lavender-scented document.  She starts off talking about how my letter was a bright spot in her day and then goes on and on for pages about her childhood in Teddington, the trips she would take in the summer to visit her mother's family in Scotland, and her favorite movie memories. And at the end she goes on this long rant about how 'awesome' I am. I'm just reading this thing thinking, 'Why would she think I'm awesome? She doesn't even know me.'    And why is there a collage in the margins that has baby pictures of her and drawings of flowers?  Hayes added.  Seriously, should I be worried about his?   Although Hayes has not yet responded to Knightley, he confirmed that several additional replies have already arrived from the actress, each longer and more involved than the last. A letter from Knightley postmarked two days ago contained a variety of highlighted newspaper clippings related to recent happenings in the actress's life and career. Another postmarked the same day contained an 80-point questionnaire with such queries as  What is your favorite cozy thing to do on a rainy afternoon?  and  Do you think I'm cool? Dont lie, lol.   In addition, Hayes told reporters that Knightley had sent him six separate film scripts with notes attached asking whether he thought the parts seemed right for her.   Today she sent a message asking how I was holding up with all the construction they're doing on the house next door to me,  said a wide-eyed Hayes.  Okay, that started a day and a half ago. How did she know about that? And somehow she got my work address, because the other day all these stuffed animals appeared on my desk along with a cardboard cutout of her from Bend It Like Beckham. My boss was just like, 'What is all this crap?' It was really embarrassing.    She apologized later in one of her letters, but still,  Hayes added.  While Hayes claimed he remains an admirer of Knightley's work, he admitted to reporters that his adoration of the actress had diminished considerably, especially after his parents started getting bizarre postcards from the actress signed,  Your son's biggest fan.   Hayes said he was considering sending a short, polite reply in a week or so thanking her for her letters and saying goodbye.   Even though the whole thing has bordered on being sort of scary, I guess I ultimately do feel a little bad for her and think she really is a sweet girl,  Hayes said.  Still, I really wish she hadn't given my address to Daniel Craig. Jesus Christ, that guy just won't quit. ",Keira Knightley Answers Fan Letter Way Too Quickly,,
"EXCLUSIVE: Univision-owned Fusion continues to expand its original content, partnering with The Onion to develop a weekly television series based on its spinoff site The A.V. Club, Deadline has learned.  Expected to premiere later this year on the millennial-focused news and satire channel, the new series will offer curated pop culture content for Fusion viewers including recommendations on film, TV and other entertainment. The show also will highlight popular content from the A.V. Club archives, such as the music series A.V. Undercover and the comedy-oriented Pick a Choice.  The news follows last week’s announcement that Univision is now the sole owner of the Fusion brand, which had been a joint venture between Univision and Disney. Univision acquired a controlling stake in The Onion in January and has folded various Onion properties including Starwipe, Clickhole and A.V. Club into the newly formed Fusion Media Group.  This marks the third time The Onion has moved into television; the satirical sports show Onion SportsDome ran for one season on Comedy Central and parody show Onion News Network ran for two seasons on IFC. It is, however, the first time the brand has built TV programming around its non-parody output.  Founded in 1993 as a media and entertainment supplement to The Onion’s print edition, A.V. Club was spun off into a distinct website in 2005. Over the years it has produced a string of online hits, including Nathan Rabin’s My World of Flops. A.V. Club also was largely responsible for bringing advice column Savage Love and its creator Dan Savage to a national audience.",The A.V. Club Sets Up At Fusion; Weekly TV Show To Bow This Year,,

According to witnesses, McConnell became visibly flustered upon realizing there was no place to hide from the Democratic colleague approaching his doorway and began ripping wads of documents from a binder and cramming them through his open jaws as rapidly as possible. Asked about the location of an upcoming meeting, McConnell, cheeks distended to many times their original size, reportedly grunted several times and gestured toward a nearby conference room.

"To become box office hits, today’s motion pictures require dedicated, hardworking actors with the talent and know-how required to execute a quality performance on screen. While I know you have many good candidates to choose from when casting your production, I believe my experience working on films such as Seven, Ocean’s Eleven, and World War Z would make me an excellent addition to your next action feature.  With my background and skills, I believe I am a natural fit for a role in your movie.  I am a dynamic, motivated worker with a wide-ranging skill set and 30 years of screen-acting experience. I am equally at home whether participating in a fast-paced action sequence, engaging in rapid-fire dialogue, creating chemistry with a potential love interest, or just brooding silently in order to build tension for the next action-filled scene. I have also learned how to perform well under pressure, especially when confronting my primary antagonist during the movie’s climax.  Whether you are producing a gritty, hard-R crime film or a family-friendly action-adventure franchise, I am confident I would tackle the challenge with the same effort and enthusiasm I’ve shown in the past as both a cop on the trail of a serial killer and a hero who must race against time to save the world from a deadly threat.  During my career, I have excelled in many different work environments, from the American West to the steppes of Tibet to the bleak post-apocalyptic future. I am a self-starter capable of working alone, something I did in The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button as a man whose backward aging left him isolated. But I’m also passionate about collaborating with others, and in the Ocean’s trilogy I worked as part of a team that executed high-profile heists. I have extensive leadership experience as well, having headed up the guerrilla unit tasked with killing Nazis in Inglourious Basterds.  In addition to being highly proficient at running across rooftops, putting on accents, firing guns while rolling or jumping, memorizing lines, and falling off of high objects onto lower ones, I am also detail-oriented and able to think outside the box.  I am mainly interested in playing a lead role in your movie, but I would be open to accepting a supporting part, and feel I would be integral to your film no matter how I was ultimately cast. As to location, I am very flexible. I would prefer to work within the greater Los Angeles area; however, if you are able to make arrangements for transportation, I would be willing to travel as far as London or Argentina.  I am also more than willing to executive-produce, if necessary.  Although I’m proud of all the projects I’ve been involved with, I believe my experience working on Ocean’s Thirteen best sums up my professional strengths. Not only did it require balancing humor with action, it also presented me with the challenge of having to deliver a new, fresh performance while reprising a well-established role. In the end, my castmates and I not only met the expectations placed on us, but actually exceeded them. I was even recognized for my work with a People’s Choice Award.  In sum, I believe my skills and talents make me uniquely qualified to appear in your movie, and I hope you will seriously consider me when casting.  If you require any information beyond what can be found in my attached résumé, please contact my references George Clooney and David Fincher.","I Believe My Experience Working On Films Such As ‘Seven,’ ‘Ocean’s Eleven,’ and ‘World War Z’ Would Make Me A Valuable Asset To Your Next Action Movie",,

"MEDFORD, OR—Considering that everyone else at Kevin Brown's sleepover party is having a great time and not freaking out about missing their mommies and daddies, 10-year-old Brandon Thompson needs to just man up and tough it the fuck out because this homesick bullshit is getting ridiculous, sources reported Saturday.  The child, who clearly just excused himself from eating pizza to call his house for the third goddamn time, had seriously better get his shit together ASAP or else all his moping around is going to ruin everyone's night.  Sources confirmed Thompson will see his parents again in less than 10 hours, so he needs to stop acting like a little bitch and relax, for Christ's sake.   It doesn't seem like Brandon is having as much fun as the rest of us,  said fellow sleepover attendee Nate Pirolli, rightly sensing that it's high time for Thompson to sack it up and get with the fucking program already.  I don't understand. We let him be first player in Gears Of War 3 and Batman: Arkham City, but he was being really quiet the whole time.    Isn't he excited that Kevin's parents are going to let us watch Superbad later? That's an R-rated movie,  he continued while a forlorn Thompson behaved as if his parents lived in Romania as opposed to 15 goddamn minutes away.  Though all he's being asked to do is spend a few hours having a blast with six of his closest friends, Thompson chose to sit out of a pre-dinner basketball game like a little pansy, claiming his allergies were acting up when in reality his puffed-up eyes and runny nose were a direct result of 30 minutes of sobbing in the Browns' upstairs bathroom.  Thompson, who by all accounts needs to just deal with it and grow the fuck up pronto, has but one obligation the whole night—the mindblowingly simple task of falling asleep—after which he will wake up, it will be morning, and his dad will come pick him up and take him to soccer practice.  Reports confirm Ryan Fitzpatrick, 10, and Jeremy Hillen, 10, aren't homesick little pussies and are totally game to try and stay up all night.   Brandon told me he had a stomach ache and that's why he didn't eat any cake,  said Nicholas Gellman, neglecting to call Thompson out on his bullshit and tell him to just nut up and eat his friend's fucking birthday cake.  I hope he feels better in the morning, because I heard we're getting chocolate chip pancakes with whipped cream.    It's weird, he had the same problem at my sleepover party too,  Gellman said of the little baby girl.  According to sources, the irony here is that Thompson spends lots of time away from his parents every single day when he goes to school, so he ought to be used to it. In fact, reports indicate his parents would both probably agree their son ought to take a step back, stop letting his irrational fears spiral out of control for a minute, and quickly reach down to double-check that he still has a set.   I know this can be a tough age for some children to sleep over at their friend's houses,  Brown's mother Debbie said.  But I do think it's important that kids venture outside their comfort zones and see for themselves that it's okay to spend the night away from home sometimes.    I will say, though, that I hope he stops coming to talk to me in the kitchen and goes to play with the other boys,  she continued.  I'm not his fucking mom.   As of 9 p.m., Thompson is making a big deal out of nothing, he's totally fine, and if he walks over to that phone to ask his parents to come pick him up instead of manning up for just one night he's going to regret it for the rest of his goddamn life.
